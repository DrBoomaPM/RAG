# Whispers of RAG: A Step-by-Step Guide to ChatbotÂ Sorcery
## Introduction
In the realm of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, the development of question-answering systems has gained significant attention. These systems aim to comprehend human language and provide accurate responses to user queries. In this article, we will explore the creation of a web application for question-answering using advanced language models and information retrieval techniques.
## Techniques Used
To accomplish this task, we will employ several techniques and tools:
1. Language Models: We will leverage OpenAI's language model, a powerful tool capable of understanding and generating human-like text. This model will be instrumental in processing and comprehending the questions posed to our system.
2. Information Retrieval: Instead of scanning the entire document for every question, we will use information retrieval techniques(RAG) to create a searchable database. This involves breaking down the document into smaller chunks, embedding these chunks, and creating a vector space for efficient retrieval.
3. Flask: A lightweight web application framework, Flask, will be used to build the user interface and handle communication between the front end and back end of our system.
